          Worked in an e-commerce warehouse. Eventually, I was entrusted with
          administrative tasks. Having recently learned a programming language
          (Java), it was natural to look up how to automate some of my work.
          During this time, I became skilled in Excel, VBA, and Autohotkey.
          Also, by this time, I was convinced that coding was something I
          enjoyed, since I was willing to do it on my free time after work.

          <summary>Why did you learn Java?</summary>

          <p>
            The choice wasn't really mine. Having already coded lots of small
            things in the past with various languages, I took a couple of
            courses to properly learn one programming language. That's how I
            learned Java (and OOP).
